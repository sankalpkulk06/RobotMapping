# RobotMapping - PROBLEM STATEMENT

A particular ‘RPA’ firm is in the process of developing a restaurant which has bot 
waiters. Bot needs to deliver the food from the specified exit door, of the kitchen 
with multiple exit doors to the specified table.

The restaurant has blocked areas where Bot cannot move and the passages 
where it can move. The layout of restaurant can be rectangular or square.

Layout map can be considered as a matrix of cells where cell with ‘0’ represents 
the passage and cell with ‘1’, the blocked area. Bot has memorised this map in 
a particular format for faster processing. Given a particular table location bot 
needs to find the path from the kitchen from the specified exit door to the table 
to serve the customer. Bot has a constraint it can move only in either right or 
down direction one step at a time (i.e. only to the adjacent cell in right or down 
direction provided it is not blocked) with first preference to right direction.

Layout matrix is stored in the file input.txt

You need to provide the code that helps the bot with the path form specific exit 
door of the kitchen to the mentioned table if there exists the one. If multiple 
paths exists your code should find any one.

Implementation
Your code should provide the following functionalities

1. Readmap:
    Layout matrix consists for ‘0’ (allowed for moving) and ‘1’ (Blocked area)
    Your code should read the layout matrix from the file input.txt (file reading)
    and store as multilist data structure (Reference multilinked list
    representation of sparse matrix).
    You need to scan layout matrix and create node whenever ‘0’ is encountered 
    in input file. Node should maintain x coordinate, y coordinate (coordinate 
    position with respect to input file, indexing starts from 0) for each location
    with ‘0’ value, link to the next node in the same row, link to the next node in 
    the same column.

2. Find path:
    Help bot to find path from the start point to the end point if one exists.
    You should access data only from the created multilinked list structure. You 
    should provide iterative implementation for this functionality. You can use 
    any data structure studied in unit2 as auxiliary data structure to hold the 
    nodes. There could be multiple paths, you program should find out any one 
    of the available paths which satisfy the constraint.

3. Store path:
    Your program should create output file out.txt 
    If path exits, program should store path coordinates in sorted order 
    (ascending order of x, for each x ascending order of y) (No other format for 
    output is accepted). If no path exists ‘-1’ should be stored in output file.

Input file description: 
    First line indicates the start point for the Bot, second line termination point, 3rd line onwards represent the layout matrix.
